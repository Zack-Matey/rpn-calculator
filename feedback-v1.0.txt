- Test cases look good. Have you figured out how much of your code
  they cover?
- The private final string's for your operations are going to add
  up quickly and become quite unmanageable. You should look at
  a data structure to manage them along with the execute() method
  (which will start to get huge soon).
- execute() seems to do multiple things; extracts the right number
  of operands _and_ calls the operator function. In addition in
  some cases throws errors. What happens if there are not enough
  operands on the stack?
